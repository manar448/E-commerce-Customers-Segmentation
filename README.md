# E-commerce Customer Segmentation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation for an **e-commerce business** using **unsupervised machine learning** techniques. By clustering customers based on their transactional behavior, the goal is to provide insights that help improve **customer retention, loyalty, and marketing strategies**.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of **customer demographic and transactional details**, including:
- **Customer ID** – Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender** – Male or Female classification.
- **City** – Location of the customer.
- **Coupon Usage Frequency** – The number of times a customer has used a coupon.
- **Transaction Status** – Indicates if the transaction was successful, failed, or pending.
- **Total Purchase Amount** – The sum of purchases made by the customer.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** – The average amount spent per transaction.
- **Purchase Frequency** – How often the customer makes a purchase.
- **Last Purchase Date** – The most recent transaction date.
- **Customer Loyalty Score** – A calculated metric to determine customer engagement.

This dataset enables segmentation based on spending behavior, coupon usage, and customer engagement trends.

## 🚀 Methodology
### 1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**
- Cleaning missing values and handling outliers.
