# E-commerce Customer Segmentation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation for an e-commerce business using **unsupervised machine learning** techniques. The goal is to analyze customer transactional behavior and identify different customer groups to improve loyalty programs, such as offering targeted coupons and promotions.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes customer demographic and transactional details, such as:
- Customer ID
- Gender
- City
- Coupon usage frequency
- Transaction status
- Purchase behavior

## 🚀 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning missing values and handling outliers.
   - Feature selection and scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding customer distribution, spending habits, and coupon usage.
3. **Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning)**
   - Implementing **K-Means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering**.
   - Evaluating cluster quality using **Silhouette Score and Inertia**.
4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Identifying key customer groups.
   - Suggesting strategies for personalized coupon offers to increase customer retention.

## 📊 Key Results
- Identification of distinct customer segments based on spending and behavior.
- Strategies for offering targeted coupons to maximize satisfaction and retention.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Implementing **Deep Learning** for customer behavior prediction.
- Enhancing feature engineering with external datasets.
- Developing a **dashboard** for real-time customer insights.
